Hello! I am currently a PhD student in Mathematics and MS student in Statistics at Washington State University (department homepage: <a href=" https://math.wsu.edu/ "> here</a>). My research focuses are generally spectral graph theory, redistricting, combinatorics, and data science. 

Before coming to WSU, I earned a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics with a minor in Physics from California State University East Bay (department homepage: <a href=" https://www.csueastbay.edu/math/ "> here</a>). 

The purpose of this website is to host my work and post about topics of interest!
