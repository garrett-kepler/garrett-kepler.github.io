<h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>
Math is where we put it! Creative approaches to problems encouraged.

<h2>Classes I've Taught</h2>
<p>
Since being a graduate student at WSU, I have had the opportunity to teach a host of mathematics courses. Below is a comprehensive list (listed semi-chronologically). Lecture notes to be posted soon! Classes with "IOR" indicate courses I was instructor of record.

<div>
	<h3>Math 325: Elementary Combinatorics (Spring 2026, IOR)</h3>
		<p>An introduction to combinatorial reasoning, proofs, and models. Focusing on the application of combinatorial techniques, we explore the world of counting.</p>

	<h3>Math 315: Differential Equations (Fall 2025, IOR)</h3>
		<p>Applying calculus-based methods to solving systems involving change in two or more variables. Covers separable equations, integrating factor method, Laplace transforms, eigenvector-based solutions, and more!</p>

	<h3>Math 108: Trigonometry (Summer 2025, IOR)</h3>
		<p>Introduction to trigonometric functions, their properties, and applications.</p>

	<h3>Accelerated Math 100 and Accelerated Math 103 (Spring 2025)</h3>
		<p>A condensed, one semester version of the typically two semester Math 100 & 103 sequence. Review of basic arithmetic and elementary algebra. Introduction to functions and linear systems of equations.</p>

	<h3>Math 103: Algebra Methods (Fall 2024, Fall 2023, Spring 2023, Fall 2022)</h3>
		<p>Fundamental algebraic operations and concepts, linear systems and inequalities, polynomial and rational functions, introduction to exponential and logarithmic functions.</p>

	<h3>Math 171: Calculus I (Summer 2024, IOR)</h3>
		<p>Differential and integral calculus of one variable. Covering limits, derivatives, integrals, analytic geometry, change of variables, etc.</p>

	<h3>Math 220: Linear Algebra (Spring 2024, IOR)</h3>
