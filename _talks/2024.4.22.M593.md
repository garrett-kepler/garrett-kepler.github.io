Abstract: Spectral graph theory (SGT) has various scientific applications, ranging from network optimization to quantum error correction. This presentation will explore the combinatorial realm of SGT by exploring its implications through several proofs of famous counting problems. By investigating methods, this talk aims to illustrate the intersection of combinatorics and spectral graph theory, offering insights into their synergistic relationship.
