Abstract: The sum of the moduli of the adjacency spectra of a graph, the adjacency energy, has been shown to connect linear algebra and the electron energy of molecules. This talk will cover a conjectured lower bound relating the energy of a graph and the size of its largest independent set. A solution for graphs with proportionally large independent sets will be shown and the consequences explored.
