Abstract: Many well established graph partitioning methods are determined by eigenvectors of matrices associated with the underlying graph. In this talk, we will explore the combinatorial intuition and computational methods involved in reconstructing a graph from subsets of such a partitioning. This will naturally lead us to characterize desirable attributes of graphs in this context and we will also uncover an application to information security.
