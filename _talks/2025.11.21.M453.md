Abstract: As Math 453 comes to a close, I have been invited to give a special topics lecture on spectral graph theory. We will discuss relevant concepts of spectral graph theory and graph partitioning. Then, we will review some open research problems regarding pertubations of the eigensystem and spectral clustering. After a demonstration of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), we will discuss applying the process to spectral partitioning problems and redistricting.
