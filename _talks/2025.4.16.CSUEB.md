Abstract: Per my former department's request, we begin by reviewing my mathematical journey up to where I am today. We then explore the basics of Gerrymandering as a concept and redistricting as a mathematical application. Using graph thoeretic ideas, we define the redistricting methods used in practice. Then, we cover current research in spectral graph theory using eigenvectors of graphs as a tool for this application. Offering many paths for further exploration, we extend an invite to partake in math's applications to redistricting, networks, and data.
