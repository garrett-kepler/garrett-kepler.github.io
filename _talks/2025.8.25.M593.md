Abstract: We will discuss the concept of Benjamini-Schramm convergence and its motivation. After discussion of properties of unimodularity in graphs, we discuss its importance in limits of random graphs. We will cover both pointed and rooted graphs and discuss the relationship between both through bias of random variables.
